  <h1>What is the horror project?</h1>

  <hr>
  <p>The horror project is kind of a project based around the horror theme, and this is a basic example of what a horror
    themed website could look like, maybe for events? And other creepy stuff. I designed this as a test of my skills,
    nothing of this is really real & most of what i'm saying is random yammering, i'm just really a fan of the whole
    horror scheme & satanism.</p>
  <p>I hope you enjoyed this little showcase of mine & how easy it can be making a template for a blog, landing page or
    whatever you want it to be.</p>

  <p>As you can see, i'm clearly just filling this out with jibberish to fill it out, i would use lorem ipsum but this
    is a much more fun way of making it.</p>
