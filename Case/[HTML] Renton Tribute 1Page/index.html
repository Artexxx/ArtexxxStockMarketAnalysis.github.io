     Mark Renton – the main character and antihero of the Trainspotting novel, is the voice of (relative) sanity among his group of friends, of many of whom he is internally very critical. He narrates his daily life – from supporting his heroin addiction with dole money and petty theft to interacting with the "normal world" – with a cynical and black-humoured wit. He is capable of fitting in with mainstream society, but is misanthropic and depressed, and uses heroin both as a means to withdraw and to give meaning to his life. Despite his dislike of animals, he is a vegetarian, and unlike most of his circle is an avid reader and interested in learning – at one point being arrested for shoplifting political theory books.
Trainspotting is the first novel by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh, first published in 1993. It takes the form of a collection of short stories, written in either Scots, Scottish English or British English, revolving around various residents of Leith, Edinburgh who either use heroin, are friends of the core group of heroin users, or engage in destructive activities that are implicitly portrayed as addictions that serve the same function as heroin addiction. The novel is set in the late 1980s.

Famously described as "the voice of punk, grown up, grown wiser and grown eloquent", the novel has since achieved a cult status, added to by the global success of the film based on it, Trainspotting (1996), directed by Danny Boyle. Welsh later wrote a sequel, Porno, in 2002. Skagboys, a novel that serves as a prequel, was published in April 2012.
