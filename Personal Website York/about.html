          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p><h5>Text referenced from website version 1.0</h5>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was crazy about Minecraft when I was young. (Not losing enthusiasm yet) I can't wait to have my own server. At the same time, I hope to make my server fantasticly. But since I don't have that much pocket money, I can't afford the high server annual rent. I used my home laptop to run the server. So a series of questions flooded me. Why is my server crashing? How are those magical fantastic effects achieved? How can I make my server more interesting? Correspondingly, I learned knowledge about intranet penetration, firewall, port mapping, programming about plugins, etc. Its short-term advantage is that I can ensure that my server is not always crashing and it became more interesting. I understand which mods could running smoothly and so on. Unfortunately, my server was still crash <b>over and over again</b>. I didn't realize that the CPU of the laptop was not suitable for long-term operation or long-term overclocking until I found out that the laptop was aging. But I still can't afford to buy a server CPU. So, the journey to explore the server has temporarily stopped. But I still believe that one day I will buy the d**n(sorry) expensive XEON or EPYC(At that time, EPYC has not been developed yet.). In fact, I was a little indifferent to Minecraft at that time... It happens that I started to like to show off to friends, So I started to learn hacking knowledge. In fact, it was not used until the end of third grade in junior high school. However, I was fortunate enough to participate in the school tour during the summer vacation in the sixth grade of primary school. I met a Korean bro who and whose friends like Minecraft very much. In junior high school, my schoolwork was not going well, so I don't have much time to spend on those things. But I am preparing for something. In fact, I am not so obedient. I used to break into the school's lab where I could make a propellant called KN-SU (Sorry, I don't know how to spell this <b>weird</b> word, its called 硝糖 in Chinese.) I filled that kind of propellant with my plastic wrap barrel length rocket(or missile?), which made my stuff fly dozens of meters away. By the way, once I <b>did</b> want to make a small missile, but I seem to be mistaken so much that my little missile became a fireworks(<b>XD</b>). Ok, maybe China has a magical power to turn my missile into a fireworks. Come on, which boy does't like missiles? Another thing that impressed me in junior high school was that I met a 'friend' on the Internet, and I saw him at a glance as someone who always used others. So I <b>gently</b> led him step by step into my trap, and eventually he spent hundreds of RMB in vain and was laughed aside by netizens. Aw. I suddenly found out that I was running off the subject <b>AGAIN</b>. Even more frightening is that I don’t know how to continue. <b>(QAQ)</b> Let us talk about what I did recently. I have done a lot of things this summer. I developed a system for the Internet of Things and tested it using a microcontroller. Not too bad, but I am not satisfied. I also learned a lot about modeling, and softwares like C4D, Maya I has a bit of a sense. I hope to use this skill to achieve the game I imaged in the future. But I can't figure out in AutoCAD. Oh, no, York. I originally wanted to print a set of missiles by 3D printer (There is a 3D printer in my great daddy's workplace). Only AutoCAD can make them perfect. You know what, I have already designed my missiles and I have already named those 18 kinds of missiles! These days I'm busy coding my website. Adobe Dreamweaver gave me 7 days, but it's not enough so I cracked it... I know it's wrong but I really want to learn something (The crack for learning purposes is <b>in law</b>). I also planned to produce some videos and sent them online, But I am <b>once again</b> blocked by my schoolwork. So, I put off this plan. I even don't know when I can finish it. </p>
